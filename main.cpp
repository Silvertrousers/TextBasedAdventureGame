class inventory {

};

class Player {
    Inventory inventory;

};

class StoryNode {
    public:
        std::vector<StoryNode*> Decisions;
        std::string Text;
        location
};

//need to be able to add story lines
//how to construct a story line
//ideally the functionality allows me to add a story line or quest, maybe have a strcutre of quests

//need to be able to construct the story graph from a set of nodes, charcters
int main(){
    StoryNode
    std::cout << "hello world" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

basically it will look like
